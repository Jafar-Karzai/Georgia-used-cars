I want to create a light theme website home page with vehicle cards for "Georgia Cars" salvage car dealer in Sharjah UAE. The website will have a clean and modern design with a focus on user experience.

 Business Context                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Georgia Used Cars is a salvage vehicle importer based in Sharjah, UAE. They purchase vehicles from US and Canada auctions (Copart, IAAI, Impact Auto) and sell them locally. Their customers include  
  DIY enthusiasts, parts dealers, and repair shops looking for affordable project vehicles.

Website should have a creative hero, visitors should be able to see the list of vehicles available for sale in the yard, and intransit (on the way), and they should be able to filter the vehicles by make, model, year, and price.
The vehicle cards should have a clean and modern design, and they should be easy to read. Also the website allows users to reserver (purchase) vehicles. 
The prices on the website are by defualt AED, but also allow uses to change from the navbar to USD. 
Their theme colors are blue and red. 
Give me a design that is clean and modern with a focus on user experience, and it should be a light theme.
