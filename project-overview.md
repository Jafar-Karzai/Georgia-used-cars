I want to create a webstie with an admin panel for a used (salvage) car dealer in Sharjah UAE (Georgia Used Cars) that purchases     │
│   and imports cars for salvage auction in the USA and Canada i.e copart.com , iaai.com , impactauto.ca which is not                    │
│   https://ca.iaai.com/ and more. I want this platform to be Super fast in performance and secure at the same time, I need to pick the  │
│   right tech stack, I'm thinking between Nextjs and Vite, and for databse I'm thinking between Supabase, Neon or Firebase. This        │
│   dealer wants to showcase their inventory on a website and have their buyers signup for special offers or early alerts on the         │
│   inventory and also want their team to be in the admin panel with different user access limits (some to add/edit/update vehicles,     │
│   others to manage acocunts including purchases and expenses, others to handle sales..etc), The want to manage their inventory, track  │
│   status of the their vehicles from the time they purchase in the acution, during transit of shipping, when they arrive to the         │
│   detination port (UAE), and finaly when they arrive to the dealer's yard. They will also be tracking days since they purchased the    │
│   vehicles from auction, and how long has it been since the vehicle is in their yard..etc. to make better decisions. They will also    │
│   be adding and tracking expenses to vehicles directly and also managing and tracking their operating expense i.e rent, business       │
│   license renewal, utilities, salaries..etc. The sales team will also be creating and sending invoices to customers and also printing  │
│   them from the admin panel, keeping track of the payments of the invoices..etc. They will also be trackign and managing inquiries     │
│   coming from the website and walkins and tracking what vehicles were they interested in. Every single Vehicle in their inventory has  │
│   a unique VIN number. At the end, they will also be having reports to give them an overview of their business, VAT fillings as per    │
│   FTA regulations in the country...etc. They will also have a one page vehicle report which shows them profit and loss of a vehicle    │
│   i.e how much the they purchased the vehicle for (final bid, auciton fee, and other late payment or storage fee), towing, shipping,   │
│   custom duty, custom clearence fee, any expenses to the vehicle for enhancement, how much they sold the car for, and what             │
│   profit/loss they have generated, this can be a one page report for any vehicle they want. For UI I'll be using schadcn/ui with       │
│   centralized desing tokens to keep consistancy of the theme and keep everything clean, I want top class ui for this project, then     │
│   website to have a clean look for salvage car dealer, rethiking how salvage car dealer website are made, we will following best       │
│   desing practices, maybe getting ideas from Apple human intelegence, creating mobile first desing and website should take             │
│   inspiration from world class leaders in the automotive industury like tesla.com having clean vehicle cards, having free VIN decoder  │
│   API to make it easy for them to add vehicles, clean and best UX/UI wizards to add vehicles, expenses, invoices..etc.  You may  add   │
│   more to this project (anything I have missed)  and create a PRD for this project.
